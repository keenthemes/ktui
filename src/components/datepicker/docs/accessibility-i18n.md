# Accessibility and Internationalization

## Overview
KTDatepicker is designed with accessibility and internationalization as first-class concerns, ensuring the component is usable by all users regardless of their abilities, language preferences, or cultural background.

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
The component provides comprehensive keyboard navigation support, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible without a mouse. This includes logical tab order, arrow key navigation, and keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

### Screen Reader Support
Full ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) compliance ensures proper screen reader integration. The component includes semantic markup, descriptive labels, and dynamic announcements for state changes.

### Focus Management
Intelligent focus management ensures logical navigation flow and prevents focus traps. The system handles focus automatically while providing customization options for specific requirements.

### Visual Accessibility
High contrast support and clear visual indicators ensure the component is usable by users with visual impairments. This includes proper color contrast ratios and alternative visual cues.

## Internationalization Support

### Locale Configuration
The system supports multiple locales for date formatting, month/day names, and UI text. Locale can be configured through attributes or JSON configuration, with automatic format adaptation.

### Date Format Localization
Date formats automatically adapt to the selected locale, including proper day/month/year ordering, separator characters, and cultural date conventions.

### Text Localization
All UI text, including button labels, month names, and error messages, can be localized to support different languages and cultural preferences.

### Right-to-Left Support
Right-to-left (RTL) language support is included for appropriate locales, with automatic layout adaptation and proper text direction handling.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Accessibility Implementation
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper HTML elements and attributes for semantic meaning
- **ARIA Attributes:** Include appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties
- **Keyboard Support:** Ensure all interactions are keyboard accessible
- **Focus Indicators:** Provide clear visual focus indicators

### Internationalization Implementation
- **Locale Detection:** Automatically detect and apply appropriate locale settings
- **Format Adaptation:** Adapt date and time formats to locale conventions
- **Text Translation:** Provide comprehensive text translation support
