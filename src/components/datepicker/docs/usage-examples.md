# Usage Examples and Scenarios

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing KTDatepicker across various use cases and scenarios. Each example demonstrates different features and configuration approaches, from basic implementations to advanced customization.

## Basic Implementation Scenarios

### Single Date Selection
The most common use case involves selecting a single date from a calendar interface. This mode provides a straightforward user experience with immediate selection feedback and automatic input population.

### Date Range Selection
Range selection enables users to choose start and end dates, with visual highlighting of the selected range. This mode is ideal for booking systems, date filtering, and period selection scenarios.

### Multi-Date Selection
Multi-date mode allows selection of multiple non-contiguous dates, useful for scheduling multiple events, availability selection, or complex date requirements. The interface includes an Apply button for confirming selections.

### Time-Enhanced Selection
Time selection adds precise time picking to any date selection mode, supporting various granularities and formats. This is essential for scheduling applications, appointment booking, and precise datetime requirements.

## Advanced Configuration Scenarios

### Template Customization
Advanced users can customize the appearance and behavior through template overrides. This includes modifying individual UI elements, changing styling classes, and implementing custom rendering logic.

### Internationalization
Locale support enables global deployment with proper date formatting, language-specific text, and cultural considerations. The system supports multiple locales with automatic format adaptation.

### Validation and Constraints
Complex applications often require sophisticated validation rules, including date range limits, disabled date sets, and custom validation logic. The system provides comprehensive validation capabilities.

## Integration Patterns

### Form Integration
Datepicker components integrate seamlessly with HTML forms, providing proper form submission, validation integration, and accessibility compliance. The system supports standard form patterns and custom validation.

### Framework Integration
The component is designed for framework-agnostic usage while providing integration patterns for popular frameworks. This includes proper lifecycle management, event handling, and state synchronization.

### API Integration
Programmatic control enables dynamic configuration, state management, and event handling. The API provides comprehensive control over component behavior and state.

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Rendering
Large-scale applications benefit from optimized rendering strategies, including template caching, selective updates, and efficient DOM manipulation. The system provides built-in performance optimizations.

### Memory Management
Proper cleanup and disposal prevent memory leaks in long-running applications. The system includes automatic cleanup mechanisms and manual disposal options.

### State Management
Efficient state management ensures responsive user interfaces with minimal re-rendering. The unified state system provides optimal performance for complex state scenarios.

## Accessibility Implementation

### Keyboard Navigation
Full keyboard accessibility ensures the component is usable by all users, including those using assistive technologies. The system provides comprehensive keyboard navigation support.

#### Segmented Input Keyboard Navigation
- **Arrow Left/Right**: Move between date and time segments
- **Arrow Up/Down**: Increment/decrement segment values
  - Numeric segments (day, month, year, hour, minute, second): Increment/decrement by 1
  - AM/PM segment: Toggle between AM and PM
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Move between segments
- **Enter**: Move to next segment
- **Number keys**: Direct input with validation and auto-advance

#### Time Picker Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between time units (hour, minute, second)
- **Arrow Up/Down**: Increment/decrement focused time unit
- **Click**: Focus specific time unit for keyboard navigation
- **Time validation**: Respects min/max time constraints

#### Calendar Keyboard Navigation
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between dates
- **Enter/Space**: Select date
- **Page Up/Down**: Change month
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last day of week

### Screen Reader Support
ARIA attributes and semantic markup enable proper screen reader integration. The component includes built-in accessibility features and customization options.

### Focus Management
Proper focus management ensures logical navigation flow and prevents focus traps. The system handles focus automatically while providing customization options.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Invalid Input Handling
Robust error handling manages invalid user input, network errors, and system failures. The system provides graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages.

### Boundary Conditions
Edge cases such as date range limits, timezone considerations, and format conflicts are handled automatically. The system provides comprehensive boundary condition management.

### Fallback Behavior
When advanced features are unavailable or fail, the system provides sensible fallback behavior. This ensures the component remains functional in all scenarios.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing
Comprehensive unit tests ensure component reliability and maintainability. The modular architecture enables thorough testing of individual features and integration scenarios.

### Integration Testing
End-to-end testing validates complete user workflows and integration scenarios. The system provides testing utilities and mock implementations.

### Performance Testing
Performance benchmarks ensure the component meets performance requirements in various scenarios. The system includes performance monitoring and optimization tools.

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Optimization
Production deployments benefit from optimized builds, caching strategies, and performance monitoring. The system provides production-ready configurations and optimization options.

### Browser Compatibility
Cross-browser compatibility ensures consistent behavior across different browsers and versions. The system includes compatibility testing and polyfill support.

### Mobile Responsiveness
Mobile-friendly design ensures optimal user experience on various screen sizes and devices. The component includes responsive design patterns and touch optimization.

## Best Practices

### User Experience Design
Following UX best practices ensures intuitive and efficient user interactions. The component includes built-in UX patterns and customization options.

### Code Organization
Proper code organization and documentation facilitate maintenance and extension. The modular architecture supports clean code practices and team collaboration.

### Version Management
Proper version management ensures compatibility and provides migration paths for updates. The system includes versioning strategies and migration documentation.
