# Alert Testing Requirements

## Overview
Automated tests are required to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the Alert component. This document outlines the required test coverage, structure, and example scenarios.

## Modular Testing Approach
- The Alert codebase is modular, with each major UI fragment and state update handled by a dedicated method.
- **Best Practice:** Write unit tests for each modular method (e.g., rendering, dismissal, button actions, etc.) to ensure isolated, focused coverage.
- Modularization enables:
  - Easier mocking and setup for each test
  - Clear separation of concerns in test files
  - Faster identification of regressions and bugs

## 1. Test Coverage
- **Core Features:**
  - Rendering of all alert types
  - Modal and non-modal alerts
  - Confirmation/cancellation flows
  - Custom content rendering
  - Dismissal and auto-dismiss
- **Configuration Methods:**
  - Attribute-based configuration
  - JSON config-based configuration
  - Merging logic and precedence
- **Template Customization:**
  - Overriding templates via config
  - Placeholders and rendering
- **Accessibility:**
  - Keyboard navigation
  - ARIA attributes
- **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
  - Invalid config
  - Missing required fields
  - Boundary conditions (e.g., multiple alerts)

## 2. Test Structure Guidelines
- Organize tests by feature or scenario for clarity
- Use clear, descriptive test names
- Ensure tests are maintainable and easy to extend
- Place all test files in `ktui/src/components/alert/tests/`

## 3. Example Test Scenarios
- Rendering an info alert displays correct icon and message
- Success alert uses correct color and icon
- Confirmation dialog displays both confirm and cancel buttons
- Custom content is rendered as expected
- Dismissible alert can be closed by user
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Invalid config falls back to defaults or shows errors
